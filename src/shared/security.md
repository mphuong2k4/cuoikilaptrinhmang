# Security & Ethics

This project is a **network programming coursework demo** for monitoring computers **with explicit consent**.

✅ Safe-by-design choices in this repo:
- No stealth/persistence (agent must be run manually).
- No keylogging / webcam / microphone.
- No remote shell / arbitrary code execution.
- Authentication required (shared token).
- Optional TLS for transport encryption (example included).

❗ Use only on machines you own or have written permission to monitor.
